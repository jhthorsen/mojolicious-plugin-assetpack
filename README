NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack - Compress and convert css, less, sass
    and javascript files

VERSION
    0.0602

SYNOPSIS
    In your application:

      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      plugin 'AssetPack';

      # add a preprocessor
      app->asset->preprocessors->add(js => sub {
        my($assetpack, $text, $file) = @_;
        $$text = "// yikes!\n" if 5 < rand 10;
      });

      # define assets: $moniker => @real_assets
      app->asset('app.js' => '/js/foo.js', '/js/bar.js');
      app->asset('app.css' => '/css/foo.less', '/css/bar.scss', '/css/main.css');

      app->start;

    In your template:

      %= asset 'app.js'
      %= asset 'app.css'

    Or if you need to add the tags manually:

      % for my $asset (asset->get('app.js')) {
        %= javascript $asset
      % }

    See also "register".

DESCRIPTION
  Production mode
    This plugin will compress scss, less, css and javascript with the help
    of external applications on startup. The result will be one file with
    all the sources combined. This file is stored in "Packed directory".

    The files in the packed directory will have a checksum added to the
    filename which will ensure broken browsers request a new version once
    the file is changed. Example:

      <script src="/packed/app-ed6d968e39843a556dbe6dad8981e3e0.js">

    This is done using "process".

  Development mode
    This plugin will expand the input files to multiple script or link tags
    which makes debugging and development easier.

    This is done using "expand".

    TIP! Make morbo watch your less/sass files as well:

      $ morbo -w lib -w templates -w public/sass

  Packed directory
    The output directory where all the compressed files are stored will be
    "public/packed", relative to the application home:

      $app->home->rel_dir('public/packed');

  Using same code on several servers with different domain names
    If you use several instances of servers with same code and want recive
    static files from separate domain name (e.g. http://static.exsample.com)
    use url_prefix attribute.
    Then links to scripts and stylesheets will look like:

      <script src="http://static.exsample.com/packed/app-ed6d968e39843a556dbe6dad8981e3e0.js">
      <link href="http://static.exsample.com/packed/app-8ff3e5f1c5cab970a3f597572f18d367.css" rel="stylesheet" />

  Preprocessors
    This library tries to find default preprocessors for less, scss, js and
    css.

    NOTE! The preprocessors require optional dependencies to function
    properly. Check out "detect" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors for more details.

ATTRIBUTES
  minify
    Set this to true if the assets should be minified.

  preprocessors
    Holds a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors object.

  url_prefix
    Holds a URL prefix string. E.g. for return scripts and stylesheets from different domain.

  rebuild
    Deprecated.

METHODS
  add
      $self->add($moniker => @rel_files);

    Used to define new assets aliases. This method is called when the
    "asset()" helper is called on the app.

  expand
      $bytestream = $self->expand($c, $moniker);

    This method will return one tag for each asset defined by the
    "$moniker".

    Will also run "less" or "sass" on the files to convert them to css,
    which the browser understand.

    The returning bytestream will contain style or script tags.

  get
      @files = $self->get($moniker);

    Returns a list of files which the moniker point to. The list will only
    contain one file if the $moniker is minified.

  process
      $self->process($moniker => @files);

    This method use "process" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors to convert and/or minify
    the sources pointed at by $moniker.

    The result file will be stored in "Packed directory".

  register
      plugin 'AssetPack', {
        cleanup => $bool, # default is true
        minify => $bool, # compress assets
        no_autodetect => $bool, # disable preprocessor autodetection
      };

    Will register the "compress" helper. All arguments are optional.

    "cleanup" will remove any old processed files. You want to disable this
    if you have other web sites that need to access an old version of the
    minified files.

    "minify" will default to true if "mode" in Mojolicious is "production".
